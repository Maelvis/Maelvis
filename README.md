### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maria, I am a legal professional taking my first (big) steps into the world of tech.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: 

She/Her

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience.
- [Cooking After Midnight](https://github.com/Maelvis/Cooking-After-Midnight), my recipes website with a heavy metal theme.


ðŸ”­ Previous projects:

- Completing [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) by Harvard University.
- [Super Smoothies](https://github.com/Maelvis/Super-Smoothies), the website I created with my team for the [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) "Introduction to Web Development". This project won the Certificate for Project Excellence in the CFG course competition.
- [Spotify Search](https://github.com/Maelvis/CFG-Spotify-Search), the Python programme I created for the "Coding Kickstarter Intensive - Introduction to Python Programming" course by Code First Girls. Use it to find songs and albums of an artist, using the Spotify API.
